                Sufficient and consistent sleep is a key aspect of a healthy lifestyle. Sleep is closely related to brain 
                activity, so it follows naturally that sleep would have various beneficial effects on the brain. 
                Beyond influencing one's mind, sleep also provides physical benefits, such as stronger hand-eye coordination 
                and improving physical appearance.

                            Sleep, which incudes amount of sleep and quality of sleep, is proven to improve consolidation of certain 
                            skills. These skills include motor(physical) skill, visual skill consolidation, declarative(fact-based)
                            memory, and the brain's ability to process information.

                            one's physical appearance. Studies have been conducted to show that those with sufficient sleep have been 
                            objectively rated as looking less tired, more healthy, and more attractive.

                            and successes to sleep. More specifically, sleep is able to help one gain insight by three times as much as 
                            staying awake.

            <div class="containerInfo">
                Sleep deprivation poses an extreme danger to one's health, as it can have severe long-term and permanent effects.
                While one may only feel a slight lack of energy, their body suffers greatly, often without signal. Rapid weight gain, 
                partial immune system failure, and psychological problems are some of the byproducts of sleep deprivation.

                            Sleep deprivation causes a decrease in leptin and an increase in ghrelin. This causes the person to 
                            feel extremely hungry, which in turn increases food intake by roughly 30%. Over time, this will lead to
                            weight gain and can even cause diabetes.

                            Sleep plays an important role in maintaining one's immune system. Therefore, sleep deprivation causes 
                            a decrease in one's immune system response and reduces the effectiveness of vaccines. Furthermore, 
                            due to the various other effects, sleep has been classified as a carcinogen. In extreme cases, sleep 
                            deprivation can lead to complete immune system failure and prove to be fatal.

                            Mood disturbances are often caused by sleep deprivation. The threat is the negative feedback loop this 
                            creates, as mood disturbances also lead to further sleep deprivation. Over time, this can cause permanent
                            behavioral and psychological problems and even lead to development of sleeping disorders.
